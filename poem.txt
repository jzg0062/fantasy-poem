On a cold winter morning,
In the time before the light
In the flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight.

When the darkness has fallen down,
And the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight.

Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know
