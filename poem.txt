// VERSE 1A
On a cold winter morning,
In the time before the light
In the flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight.

When the darkness has fallen down,
And the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight.

// VERSE 1B
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know

// CHORUS 1A
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

// CHORUS 1B
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

// VERSE 2A
As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes

Running back from the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars

// VERSE 2B
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight

// CHORUS 2A
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

// CHORUS 2B
