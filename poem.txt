// VERSE 1A
On a cold winter morning,
In the time before the light
In the flames of death's eternal reign, we ride towards the fight.

When the darkness has fallen down,
And the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight.

// VERSE 1B
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as they go
In fire and pain, now once again we know

// CHORUS 1A
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

// CHORUS 1B
So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

// VERSE 2A

// VERSE 2B

// CHORUS 2A

// CHORUS 2B
